# BioSky

A decentralized biodiversity observation platform built on the AT Protocol.

## Overview

BioSky lets users record and share biodiversity observations on the federated AT Protocol network. Data follows [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) standards for scientific interoperability.

**Your data, your server** - Observations are stored on your Personal Data Server (PDS), not a central database.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run appview
```

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for full setup instructions.
